Welcome to the Deep Learning repository, which contains a diverse collection of machine learning and deep learning models implemented in Python and PyTorch. This repository aims to demonstrate various techniques and applications in the field, providing practical examples and insights.

The Fall Detection project focuses on identifying if a person has fallen based on the relative positions of keypoints, aspect ratio ,and changes in dimesion of bounding box of the person. This model is particularly useful in healthcare and elderly care settings where prompt detection of falls can significantly improve response times and outcomes.

In the Posture Detection project, a model is developed to classify different human postures using keypoint data. This application can be utilized in ergonomics, physical therapy, and activity monitoring to ensure correct postures and prevent injuries.

The Shortest Path on Map project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest distance between any two nodes on a map. This solution is essential for navigation systems, logistics planning, and network optimization, providing efficient route planning capabilities.

The License Plate Recognition project involves reading and storing text from car license plates. The model preprocesses images to align the text horizontally before applying optical character recognition (OCR). This application is vital for automated toll systems, parking management, and traffic monitoring.

Additionally, the repository includes several smaller projects that serve as foundational exercises in machine learning. The Linear Regression project introduces the basic principles of linear regression, providing a simple yet powerful tool for predictive analysis.

For image classification tasks, the repository contains models trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The MNIST project focuses on classifying handwritten digits, while the CIFAR-10 project deals with the classification of 10 different classes of images. These projects highlight the capabilities of neural networks in recognizing patterns and features in images.

The Sine Wave Predictor project uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict sine wave values, demonstrating the application of RNNs in time series forecasting and sequential data analysis.

To run these models, Python and PyTorch are required. Detailed instructions for setting up the environment and running each project are provided within the respective project directories.
